# Analyzing-Software-Industry-Trends

In this data engineering initiative, we will employ the web scraping capabilities provided by the brightdata.com platform to extract comprehensive data from G2.com. This data will encompass diverse information available on G2.com. Subsequently, we will transfer the acquired dataset to Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing solution. Within Snowflake, we will conduct the necessary parsing and structuring operations to organize the data effectively.

Our next step involves leveraging Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. Using Tableau's capabilities, we will create interactive and insightful dashboards that convey the essence of the scraped G2.com data. These dashboards will present data-driven insights, trends, and patterns within the software company landscape, derived from the amalgamation of web-scraped information and Snowflake's well-organized data storage.

In summary, our data engineering project entails web scraping via brightdata.com to collect a comprehensive dataset from G2.com. This data will be stored in Snowflake and undergo transformation processes to optimize its structure. The final step involves using Tableau to generate visually appealing and interactive dashboards, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into the software industry landscape.
